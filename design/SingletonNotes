Design pattern 

1] Singleton
Only one instance of the class is created

- we can break single pattern by using reflection , by accessing the private constructor

- to prevent it we can throw exception in constructor
- We can use enum , by default constructor of enum is private, we cannot public constructor for enum, and You cannot invoke an enum constructor yourself so reflection cannot be used here

- We can break singleton by implementing seriaziable interface
- but can prevent it by implementing read resolve
-The readResolve method is called when ObjectInputStream has read an object from the stream and is preparing to return it to the caller

- We can break singleton by cloning, to prevent it, can can through exception in the clone method


ENUM
- Every enum is internally implemented by using Class.
- Every enum constant represents an object of type enum.
- Enum type can be passed as an argument to switch statements.
- Every enum constant is always implicitly public static final. Since it is static, we can access it by using the enum Name. Since it is final, we canâ€™t create child enums.
- We can declare the main() method inside the enum. Hence we can invoke the enum directly from the Command Prompt.
