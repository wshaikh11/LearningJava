Need of exception handling?
 - In the real world project, it is important to handle errors correctely and simultameously provide meaningful error message to the client
 
 How can we make error response clear in spring?
 - We are lucky enough that spring provide build in support for error handling
 
 Annotation used for spring boot error handling
 - @RestController
 - @ControlAdvice - This annotation handles the exceptions globally, it allows you to use the same ExceptionHandler for multi-controller
                  - This way we can define how to treat an exception in one place because this handler will be called whenever the exception is thrown from the class that are coverd in CA
 - @ExceptionHandler
 
 
 It is advisable to use proper message in exception becase client can see it, he does not have to do anything with null pointer exception and line of error in the code that occurs, we should displey proper message to the client
